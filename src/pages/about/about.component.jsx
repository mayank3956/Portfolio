                Hi there! I am <strong>&nbsp; MAYANK GARG</strong>
                <br />I work on Back-end as well as Front-end, API Designing,
                code reviews. I also keep a good eye on Clean Coding, the latest
                features whether used or not in any code, SOLID Principles..
                <br />
                My hobbies are solving Data Structures problems, learn about new
                and upcoming tech, experiment with different parts of Computer
                Science.
                <br />
                Got an opportunity to learn from and also apply the skills on
                the live project related to Google Adwords and complete it from
                scratch to capable of delivering a high-quality production-grade
                product.
                <br />
                Along with that, I also help people as a COACH on their journey
                of becoming a professional programmer.
                <br />I love learning about new technologies, what problems are
                they solving and How can I use them to build better and scalable
                products.
                <br /> <br />
